# Vision

### We aim to share in the growth that comes from collective expression.

This festival is a celebration of our interdependent evolutionâ€”a co-created space where we come together in our creative beingness and ever-becoming. Through music, art, skill-sharing, play, and mutual care, it is a space where we can experiment with and collectively realize the world we wish to inhabit. This is not a space for spectators, but a living, breathing participatory culture of transformation.

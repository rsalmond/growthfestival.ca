# Our Values and Guiding Principles

The ethos of the festival is to encourage social engagement and center relationality. As such, the following are guidelines and values we hold in our hearts and apply with our hands as we create this project: 

## 1. Interdependence, Growth & Becoming

We honor the individual and collective evolution of every participant. This space exists to nourish becoming and celebrate our shared transformations.

We are all growing together. There is no hierarchy of creativity here—no fixed roles. Everyone contributes something vital.


## 2. Radical Inclusion, Safer Spaces, and Relational Respect

We are committed to creating a space that is actively anti-racist, anti-fascist, and free from homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and ableism. As organizers we aim to address these things actively and with care.

No cops, no Nazis—we reject oppressive systems and individuals who represent or uphold them.

Our approach to radical inclusivity acknowledges the Paradox of Tolerance—intolerance will not be tolerated.

Respect is fundamental—respect the land, yourself, and each other in all that you do.

## 3. Community Co-Creation & Participation

This is a participatory gathering, not a spectacle. Everyone contributes—through skills, energy, creativity, and care. Every dance floor needs a dancer, every dish needs washing. Every person has something valuable to contribute.

The festival thrives on reciprocity—a mutual exchange where everyone gives and receives.
You are not here to be a bystander or to consume or for a checklist; we are here to participate, contribute, and belong.

## 4. Mutual Aid & Gift Economy

We practice anti-capitalism and reject commodification: nothing is bought, sold, or traded—everything is offered freely in the spirit of mutual aid, abundance, and radical generosity.

This is an anti-capitalist space—one where we practice abundance, not scarcity and we don’t have to ‘produce’ or perform to the standards that capitalism demands in our every day lives. We act in the interest of each other towards mutual aid and collective benefit and wellbeing.

Giving and receiving are sacred acts.

## 5. Abolitionist & Harm Reduction Ethics

We center abolitionist values and anti-carceral approaches to conflict—prioritizing restorative and transformative justice in organizing and in the broader community of the festival. We employ these principles when engaging in learning moments and aim towards de-escalation and seeing shared humanity. 

We choose harm reduction, recognizing autonomy of individuals to make the best choices for them. As organizers we aim to provide a platform to support best care practices to those aims.

We center care, compassion, and accountability over punishment in all our interactions. 

Safety is co-created, not enforced. 
We build a safer space through mutual responsibility. 
As organizers we are accountable to each other and festival goers

## 5. Earth-Centered Living & Responsibility

We are in relationship with the land, not on it. We honor the earth through reciprocity.

We are mindful of consumption and the hidden costs to earth upcycling, recycling, and using second-hand and sustainable materials first and being mindful of waste.

We acknowledge treaties and the sovereignty of Indigenous Peoples, and strive to be in right relationship with the land and its original stewards—before, during, and after the festival.

## 6. Collective Evolution & Healing

We celebrate individual and collective transformation—emotional, spiritual, and interpersonal growth are core to our shared experience.

This is a space for learning, unlearning, and skill sharing—a living practice of co-evolution.

## 7. Time, Flow & Collective Rhythm

While there is a schedule, we recognize that time is fluid, and flow matters. We build structure that supports, not constrains, creativity.

The program is curated with equity and freshness in mind—new voices, shared platforms, and rotating leadership.

# Our Mission

## To celebrate creatively together!

As a celebration of our ever becoming and recognizing the complexity of these times and an ever demanding world that decreases access to ‘third spaces’, growth exists to provide a space where we can engage in the creative process of exploring, evolving, and enchanting our collective consciousness. Growth is a platform for experimenting with who and what we are. Growth provides structure and framework as a starting point and context to try out what it means to embody a more creative world.

To do this well, as organizers, we adhere to these [guiding principles](values-and-principles.qmd). These principles can be used internally but they are also the heart of the festival and undergird the collective agreements for anyone participating. Further, as a mode of accountability to each other, the earth and beyond, these values help to centre and give guidance to the how of what are doing together and how to be in best relationship.

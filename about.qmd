Growth Festival is an independent community driven back yard celebration of interdependent evolution.

Every year we bring new gifts to the web of community we are all a part of. Growth is an invitation to celebrate our growth together, and to share the gifts of our growth with each other, whatever form they make take. Growth is also an invitation to join us at the height of our gardenâ€™s growth and to celebrate the growth of all the life this land sustains and nourishes.

Yoga Nas is an anatomy enthusiast who has been teaching yoga in the region for over 10 years. She loves creating yoga sequences that encourage moving in ways that are playful and challenge the habitual patterns of our bodies and minds. This fun and flowy practice will be an experience without any sitting or laying down so **feel free to skip the mat** and come explore what it feels like to move and breathe without the confines of that little box.

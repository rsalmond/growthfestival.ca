mosspossum: raps and beats for woodland creatures and people that don't take themselves too seriously. mosspossum strives to make each show interactive, odd, and different from the last. Song topics such as swamps, forests, cats, robot grannies, skunks, monsters, etc. inspire costume changes during live shows. mosspossum is also a big fan of improvisation, often freestyling and occasionally making a new beat / song from scratch during live shows. Inspired by funk, dub, and 90's rap, mosspossum likes to make weird songs to make people think, laugh, scratch their heads, and get moving.

mosspossum loves you ... mostly.

Delfine, a groove goddess from Waterloo, brings the pulse of the underground to the heart of the forest. Known for her deep house and tech house sets, she transforms woodland clearings into hypnotic dance havens. With decks nestled beneath the trees, her forest parties are legendary -- where baselines ripple like streams and owls hoot in time. Barefoot and beaming, Delfine lives for sunrise moments and deep grooves that connect dancers to the earth and each other.

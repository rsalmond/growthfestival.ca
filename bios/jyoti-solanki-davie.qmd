### Yoga

Take part in a gentle morning yoga practice. Focusing on movements that are grounding and align with the elements of nature. We'll utilize Ayervedic principles to explore these elements in our body. Each of us has all five elements in different ratios, Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space / Ether. Balance the elements within through your presence and breath. Meet yourself where you are, and we'll practice together.

### Spoken Word

Jyoti will read from her dark ecopunk fantasy series, "A Forest Without Trees". In the world of the Federation, everything is fun and games but nothing is as it seems. The year is 2640, and our descendants survived the climate breakdown but continue to be divided with how we live on the planet. Trapped inside a giant perimeter shield, Tara fights to escape and keep her secrets hidden before the Federation can harness her extra cerebral ability for their diabolical schemes.

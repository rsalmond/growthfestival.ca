Onion Honey makes music like an old fashioned string band - sweet and sharp and savoury, mountain music fresh from the Grand River Valley. The Kitchener based Canadian Folk Music Award nominated quartet play retrofitted traditional tunes and original songs with old souls.

Onion Honey has been heard on radio stations across Canada, showcased at Folk Music Ontario in 2023, and have performed at a number of festivals including Mariposa Folk Festival 2024, Banjofest in Guelph, Springtide Festival in Uxbridge, Winterfolks in Toronto, River Valley Bluegrass festival, and more.

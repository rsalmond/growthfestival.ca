Hi, I'm Sylvia Chapman--- experienced knit and crochet experimenter!

### Crochet 101 Workshop

Circles, squares, and freeform 2.5 hours.

Whether you're a total noob or learned years ago and forgot, we'll go over the basics you need to get the creative juices flowing. We'll focus on single crochet (the basic stitch) aiming to learn basic shapes. Heads up, we'll be doing some counting! Open to experienced beginners, just know that we'll be focusing on the basics for the first 1.5 hours. Once people get into a bit of a flow, we can get into more nuanced ideas. These basic shapes form the basis for making amigurmis, summer tops, hats and more. I suggest you focusing on learning one shape to start!

Basic materials available by donation: **bringing your own is ideal**.

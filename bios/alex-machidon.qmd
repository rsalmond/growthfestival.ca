Alex Machidon likes to make noises, and he hopes you enjoy them too. Over many years of performing in dive bars and 5 star hotels, festivals and special events, as well as many a campfire, he has received glowing reviews such as "That was incredible, you made my night!" "Awesome singing bro!" and "Put the hockey game back on!"

With musical roots in KW Ontario, Alex has been blessed to be able to create music with an ever expanding roster of amazing musicians across this great land of Canada (with a smidge of Asia), from Quebec, to the Yukon and British Columbia (Kootenay Life!!) and now back in lovely KW.

Mainly a vocalist, guitar player, and song writer, Alex plays an eclectic mix of music as a solo artist, band mate and collaborator. He aims to create an experience of fun, entertainment, inclusion, and joy.

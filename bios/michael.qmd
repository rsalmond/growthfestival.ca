My name is Michael. When I discovered song circles I discovered an easy way to feel better fast. I'm not "a singer", I just know that singing feels good. 


Our song circle will include both structured and free-form sounding and song. Our songs will be simple, sung with the intention to raise our spriits, connect, and fill our souls with good moods and attitudes like grattitude, reverence, peace, and friendliness. Guidance and lyrics will be provided, most songs will be sung acapella, and all levels of experience are warmly welcomed.

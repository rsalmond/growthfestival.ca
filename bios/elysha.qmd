### Stitched Together: Visible Mending

Mending our clothes is a tangeable, everyday act of resistance. Whimsical, practical, subtle or overt, every stitch builds a world where perfect isn't the goal but rather creativity, care, and tenacity. And it's better together!

All experience welcome. To keep it social, we'll focus on hand-stitching rather than sewing machine.

I'll bring supplies to share (needles, thread, yarn, pins, patches etc.). You'll bring 1-3 items to repair (plus, optional: thread/yarn, notions, scrap fabric or old clothes to become patches).

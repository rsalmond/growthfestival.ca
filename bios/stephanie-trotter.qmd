With over a decade of experience spinning, knitting, and textile arts, I'v ebeen honing my craft since 2008. You may have seen me at the Flying Squirrel Yarn Store in Waterloo, where I am the handspinning teacher. Since 2018 I've been passionate about teaching others to unlock their creative potential through spinning.

### Learn to Drop Spindle

Ready to spin your creativity into something extraordinary? Join us for a fun and hands-on Learn to Drop Spindle class with Steph! Whether you're a fibre newbie or a cratfing pro, Steph will teach you the ancient (and super satisfying) art of turning wool into yarn using a drop spindle. Wool is included, and spindles will be available to learn on in the class. Feel free to bring your spindle if you have one, and you'll leave with your yarn and the skills to make more!

Rob is a lapsed skeptic who threw spirituality out with the religious bathwater in his teens then spent years looking for meaning in all the wrong places. A meditation teacher, an enthusiastic dancer, and a clumsy but spirited artist, his favourite thing in the world is to tell you that story of that thing that happened that one time. If you’re not careful he may sneak up and ask you what it means to feel alive.

### Being Human for Human Beings

 Philosophy for real life, we’ll juggle ideas and see if we can change our minds. What does it mean to consider yourself a self? Where does the voice in your head come from? Who is it talking to? What do we actually value? As the mindfulness monkeys say; it’s not what you think.

Let’s get weird about awareness.

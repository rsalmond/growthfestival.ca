### Star Trek

Join memers of the U.S.S. Vector, a Nova Class Science Vessel affiliated with Starfleet International, as we discuss contemporary Trek, old Trek, and Canon Trek. The central storyline of Discovery seems to be the "Hero's Journey" with Michael Burnham as the Hero. This is different from every other Star Trek series. So we ask the questions: How is Discovery unique, similar, and different than other Star Trek series?

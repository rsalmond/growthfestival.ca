Trash Theatre, AKA Crystal Bradford & Liam Kijewski offers eco-arts programming focusing on youth workshops to inspire growing minds to work towards sustainability. Making appearances at schools, libraries, festivals, and private events, Trash Theatre has been providing nature inspired art experiences since 2006. Workshops range from junk instruments, to mask making to pond studies.

### Loop There it Is

This workshop is a collaborative sound collage experiment. Using a looper pedal and a microphone, we will layer our musical ideas to create pieces of community art. Sometimes bizarre, sometimes amazing, and always fun, looping as a group is enjoyable for all ages and musical abilities. It's a great way to learn about rhythm, harmony and melody, while gaining confidence on the microphone.

Come get weird!

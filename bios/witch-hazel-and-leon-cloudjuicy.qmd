DJ Witch Hazel and Leon CloudJuicy (swampstep, plampcore, crunchroot, rolli-polli) Meshing their musical tastes together since the days of environmental radio show Non-Toxic Airwaves, they have been playing fun songs for fun people at fun places over the years. Returning to Growth, Witch Hazel and CloudJuicy are bringing some Beachvill bounce. Their sets can be eclectic but this time they will be slangin some bangers and zangers. Head nod type musi for the people with twigs in their hair. 

Recommend if you like some good ol' filthy bass with a touch of "why are they playing this song?".

Drink some water.

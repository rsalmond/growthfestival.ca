I am a highschool CS teacher with a PhD in math but also a love for the written word. Although novels for teens are my first love, there's almost nothing I won't write. I write stand-up comedy, poems on economics, sermons on the environment, and op-ed pieces. I write rap songs to promote musicals at my high school, then perform them over the PA to kids who can't believe I'm a CS teacher. I've emceed at my high schools's commencement every year since 2020, which I begin every year with a dance. My love for creativity extends to YouTube, where my mathy animations have attracted thousands of commetns from adults thanking me for helping them visualize math in a new way. My goal as a children's author is to help kids find agency in their lives amidst their foibles through the medium of laughter.

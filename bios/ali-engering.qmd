I've lived in the [Haldimand Tract](https://uwaterloo.ca/food-future-waterloo-region/indigenous-perspectives/haldimand-tract-and-land-back) for 15 years, where Iv'e cultivated two passions: slacklining and connecting with nature. I discovered highlining during the pandemic and now regularly walk lines over Elora Gorge. I host weekly slackline jams in Waterloo Park, sharing the mental and physical benefits of this meditative practice. I also lead forest bathing sessions through my business, \*Into the Outside Mind\*, helping people slow down, build relationships with the land, and connect with more-than-human communities. I'm excited to offer these nature-based experiences at the festival and create space for grounding, presence, and belonging.


### Slackline Workshop

Learn to slackline! Zero experience required. All you need is the ability to stand on two legs. I will also go over the origins and many styles / options of slacklining.

### Nature Mindfulness Workshop

Get a small taste of a forest bathing session. We will start with grounding into practice you will then be led in a partnered sensory activity, experiencing nature in a new way.

Born an artist, Dottie has always been a strange, awkward, silly type of person, struggling with social connection and found that creating art to communicate her feelings and thoughts was how she found connection and expression of her person; since the early age of four. Dottie completed a bachelors of fine arts at Emily Carr institute of art and Design in Vancouver, and here is where she branched off from painting and drawing into metal fabrication sculpture and silk screening on fabrics. She has taught drawing and painting from the age of 18-36 and has been on a teaching hiatus since giving birth to her son in 2022. A lover of nature, fascinated by the sacred Geometry found in the patterns of life, she intends to create art that mainly inspires feelings of Peace, Love, & Wonder in her works. Fascinated by light, most of her work is created to look different ways, under different beams of light.

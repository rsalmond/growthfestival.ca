title: "Bossi Nova"

My name is Bossi Nova (AKA Alex Bossi). I've been performing music professionally for eleven years. After hundreds of performances in many different environments Growth reamains one of my absolute favourites. I have been lucky to have a deep connection with Sasha, the property, and the community surrounding it for years. This year I feel even luckier that I get to curate a music journey for some of my dearest friends in one of my favourite places. Expect intricately woven layers of percussion, deep & lush bass, and transcendent melodies.

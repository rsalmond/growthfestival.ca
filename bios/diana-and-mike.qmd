title: "Diana & Mike Erb"
---

Diana and Mike have been playing acoustic traditional and original folk/roots music
together for over a decade as a duo and with various larger band iterations such as
"Twas Now" -- A Canadian Folk Music Award Nominee in 2018. Born and raised in KW, they've
been active within the local music and arts community throughout their lives and continue
to explore new ways to foster community through music. They're excited to share some old
favourites and original songs as part of this year's Growth Festival.

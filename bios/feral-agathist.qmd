title: "Feral Agathist"
---

Feral Agathist is a sound art project from Ben O'Brien. Currently excited with
making cassettes, radios, feedback loops and synthesizers have a conversation
with each other. This plays out with little to no formal structure and an
opportunity to improvise on the spot and zone out on strange noises dancing
around with each other. The word 'agathist' refers to a doctrine that all things
tend toward ultimate good. With the chaotic nature of manipulating electronics I
like to think that's where it ends up for the listener.

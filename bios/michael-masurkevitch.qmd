Michale Masurkevitch is vastly grateful to spend most of his time acting, writing, singing, songwriting, parenting, and playing with different forms of yoga and martial arts.

Meditation, self-awareness, and self love have become the backbone of his abilities and inspirations for all of these activities, and his priority in life has become his connection to energy and source from which his other desires seem to flow.

As a former self identified douche bag he continues to learn from the stories, energy and emotions of the humans and world around him.

As he continues to guide meditations with friends outside of bars and dance parties, he is very excited to share his favourite practice with Growth.

A reconnection of Sath, Chith and Ananda through visualizing the chakra points and their colours, while allowing their ocrresponding emotions, and inviting their corresponding elemental and angelic energies.

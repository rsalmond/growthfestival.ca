### Healing Our Money Relationships for Social Change

As we live and work through the byproudct of a very intentional system that is designed in oppression, our personal relationship with money suffers. If money is a tool/weapon that society uses for oppression, what does that mean for those of us dedicated to social change?

In this workshop, we will begin to look at our personal money story and the cognitive dissonance of living in capitalism within the context of the Trauma of Money Method, and discuss what it would mean for our social movements to be well-resourced. Money is a tool - not a weapon - in the hands of an asshole it can kill, and in the hands of an activist, it can feed a nation.

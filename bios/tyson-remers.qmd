title: "Tyson Remers"

Tyson Remers is much more deeply weird than he might first appear. Back in '22 he finally published his Epic Fantasy novel, "The Shaman's Daughter". As well as "Trying to write the book I wanted to read when I was younger", Tyson has been quoted as saying "I just tried to write the trippiest book possible". Recently he has put his writing efforts towards "tripping out" younger readers, with a new (much shorter) work entitled "The Ghosts of Fextail Cove". It's a haunted first-romance story that the author has described as "Twin Peaks meets The X-Files ... for kids".

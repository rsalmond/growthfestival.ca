title: "Mov"

Traversing war, trauma, sex, and joy with tales from afar, Mov has lived life to the fullest. Biosphereist, nihilist, and hedonist - weaving life into thick, dark, sexy webs. Trauma and sex addiction often go hand in hand. With a flair for setting the stage and taking you on a journey with them, Mov has stories. They have performed at places like Hillside Festival and the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word and regularly slam in Guelph.

> Mov is pronounced like the colour mauve (but either way is fine).

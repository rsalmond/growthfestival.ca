Keechakat is a multi-talented artist who weaves healing sonic energy into every part of her life.
She combines her soulful voice, dreamy ukelele, and intimate lyrics to create a unique and ethereal
musical experience. She's a professionally trained musician who has been creating original music since
toddlerhood and has recently begun sharing her original artistry with others. She feels incredibly
grateful to finally get to share it with all of you cool cats at Growth this year.

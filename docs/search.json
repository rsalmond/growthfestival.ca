    "text": "The ethos of the festival is to encourage social engagement and center relationality. As such, the following are guidelines and values we hold in our hearts and apply with our hands as we create this project:\n\n\nWe honor the individual and collective evolution of every participant. This space exists to nourish becoming and celebrate our shared transformations.\nWe are all growing together. There is no hierarchy of creativity here‚Äîno fixed roles. Everyone contributes something vital.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to creating a space that is actively anti-racist, anti-fascist, and free from homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and ableism. As organizers we aim to address these things actively and with care.\nNo cops, no Nazis‚Äîwe reject oppressive systems and individuals who represent or uphold them.\nOur approach to radical inclusivity acknowledges the Paradox of Tolerance‚Äîintolerance will not be tolerated.\nRespect is fundamental‚Äîrespect the land, yourself, and each other in all that you do.\n\n\n\nThis is a participatory gathering, not a spectacle. Everyone contributes‚Äîthrough skills, energy, creativity, and care. Every dance floor needs a dancer, every dish needs washing. Every person has something valuable to contribute.\nThe festival thrives on reciprocity‚Äîa mutual exchange where everyone gives and receives. You are not here to be a bystander or to consume or for a checklist; we are here to participate, contribute, and belong.\n\n\n\nWe practice anti-capitalism and reject commodification: nothing is bought, sold, or traded‚Äîeverything is offered freely in the spirit of mutual aid, abundance, and radical generosity.\nThis is an anti-capitalist space‚Äîone where we practice abundance, not scarcity and we don‚Äôt have to ‚Äòproduce‚Äô or perform to the standards that capitalism demands in our every day lives. We act in the interest of each other towards mutual aid and collective benefit and wellbeing.\nGiving and receiving are sacred acts.\n\n\n\nWe center abolitionist values and anti-carceral approaches to conflict‚Äîprioritizing restorative and transformative justice in organizing and in the broader community of the festival. We employ these principles when engaging in learning moments and aim towards de-escalation and seeing shared humanity.\nWe choose harm reduction, recognizing autonomy of individuals to make the best choices for them. As organizers we aim to provide a platform to support best care practices to those aims.\nWe center care, compassion, and accountability over punishment in all our interactions.\nSafety is co-created, not enforced. We build a safer space through mutual responsibility. As organizers we are accountable to each other and festival goers\n\n\n\nWe are in relationship with the land, not on it. We honor the earth through reciprocity.\nWe are mindful of consumption and the hidden costs to earth upcycling, recycling, and using second-hand and sustainable materials first and being mindful of waste.\nWe acknowledge treaties and the sovereignty of Indigenous Peoples, and strive to be in right relationship with the land and its original stewards‚Äîbefore, during, and after the festival.\n\n\n\nWe celebrate individual and collective transformation‚Äîemotional, spiritual, and interpersonal growth are core to our shared experience.\nThis is a space for learning, unlearning, and skill sharing‚Äîa living practice of co-evolution.\n\n\n\nWhile there is a schedule, we recognize that time is fluid, and flow matters. We build structure that supports, not constrains, creativity.\nThe program is curated with equity and freshness in mind‚Äînew voices, shared platforms, and rotating leadership."

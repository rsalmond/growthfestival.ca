and email money transfers can be sent to [donations@growthfestival.ca](mailto:donations@growthfestival.ca).

Suggested donation is $50 for the weekend (or think of it as $25 / night).

To see where the money goes, all [our expenses have been made public](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/e/2PACX-1vSdYrmyhNATk5joTprdlClZBsyZWNICSrKLt1Ka2CIpBk5UwdqkUTZNiijrvRGv6EEVTJCjxEhmoZLc/pubhtml#gid=868047919)

## What To Do

* Arrive **no earlier than 2pm** on Friday Aug 22nd.
* Check in at the front gate.
* Unload your gear then **move your car**. To avoid unwanted attention please do not park on the street. The lot at the nearby Michael's (University & Erb) is large and usually empty. 

## What To Bring

* Yoga mat
* Plates, cups, and cutlery to help reduce trash at meal times.
* Camping gear if you plan to stay Friday / Saturday evening.

## Volunteer

We need your help to pull this whole thing off. If you'd like to take a shift on the Vibe Check patrol or staffing the Front Gate please [sign up here](https://form.everestwebdeals.co/?form=33e83f7993e5c71b1e1d367c3f2c02f9).

We're also looking to keep track of anyone who has formal CPR / first aid training, if this is you please notify the front gate at check-in.

And we'll take as many extra hands as we can get to help us tear down on Sunday morning after breakfast.

## Vibe Checkers

Our Vibe Check volunteers will be easily spotted in their bright yellow safety gear. If you notice anything you don't like the look of, or feel in any way uncomfortable, please report to a Vibe Checker ASAP and they will connect you with the right people.

## IMPORTANT UPDATE Saturday Aug 23rd @ 11:45am

Hello friends! I'm writing for Sasha who is very busy dealing with many things.

Important update from the crew organizing Growth 2025.

### 1st and most important update

We were warned by bylaw last night about the noise. We are prepared to proceed this evening and it is absolutely critical that we have everyone's help in making it safe and reducing risk. 

For this reason, please forget everything you think you know about bylaw and simply do as we ask: should bylaw arrive, unless they are speaking DIRECTLY TO YOU do not speak with them, go directly to front gate, vibe check, or an organizer and let them know. 

We need absolutely everyone to keep a cool head and let us handle the event we have organized. We're on the hook for this, please let us take care of it.

### 2nd, still very important

We have carefully adjusted speakers and sound equipment to minimize sound pollution. What we cannot do without your help is reduce sound pollution from cheering, shouting, hooting, and hollering. 

Trust us, we're excited too! We're just not excited about the prospect of a noise citation. PLEASE resist the urge to cheer and clap for our wonderful performers after sunset. Snap fingers, wave, show your wonderful smile. Share joy, just do it quietly.

### Finally

Due to classic festival uncertainties, we had to make last minute changes to the schedule. Here are the updated times.

We would also like to have JP start the magic show at 5:30pm.

Main Stage

3:30-4:15 zozo
4:15-5:00 eq8
5:00-5:30 eddie
5:30-6:00 mosspossum
6:00-6:45 delfine
6:45-7:30 skinnydip
7:30-8:15 bossi
9:00-9:45 kasia
9:45-10:30 witchhazel & cloudjuicy

Thank you SO MUCH for helping us pull this off. Can't wait to shake booty with you all tonight!
